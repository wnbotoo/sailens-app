# Bundled models: provenance and licenses

> This document satisfies the model record requirements in `../DISTRIBUTION_NOTICE.md`. **It is not
> legal advice**; have someone familiar with open-source licensing review it before release.
>
> The models' **technical contract** (shape / layout / class order / performance red lines) is in
> Sailens Android's [`models.md`](../sailens/docs/models.md). This document only covers **what these two weights are, where
> they came from, and under what license**.

## What is bundled

```text
app/src/main/assets/sem.tflite      semantic walkable-area segmentation
app/src/main/assets/det.tflite      obstacle detection
```

Sailens Android git-ignores `app/src/main/assets/*.tflite` because it ships zero weights; here they
are tracked as ordinary files. They are what makes this official distribution AGPL-3.0.

## sem.tflite

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Model name | `yolo26n-sem` |
| Original file name | `yolo26n-sem_float16.tflite` |
| sha256 | `69e240a9b7ba81b83cef1ffc0bac77698a47a37544c7517259b9accd599ab4f5` |
| Upstream project | Ultralytics YOLO26 |
| Download source | ⚠️ **exact release URL TBD** — from the canonical Android assets in `ultralytics/yolo-flutter-app` releases (v0.3.5 release notes mention "full YOLO26 semantic segmentation support"; the Android semantic assets trace back to v0.2.0 canonical assets) |
| Model version / release tag | ⚠️ **TBD** |
| Code license | AGPL-3.0 (Ultralytics) |
| Weights license | AGPL-3.0 (per Ultralytics' position; whether copyleft applies to weights is contested in the industry — this repository takes the strict reading of their claim) |
| Training dataset | Cityscapes (19 trainId classes) |
| Dataset license | 🔴 **NON-COMMERCIAL**. This constraint travels with the weights and is independent of any code license |
| Redistribution | Permitted, under AGPL-3.0 (complete corresponding source must be provided) |
| Commercial use | 🔴 **Not permitted** (Cityscapes dataset constraint). A free app has a "non-commercial" argument; **any commercialization, including selling hardware, requires replacing this with a sem model trained on commercially usable data** |
| Export format | onnx2tf float16 export, NHWC |
| I/O | FLOAT32 `[1,640,640,3]` → `Identity` FLOAT32 `[1,640,640,19]` dense scores |
| Runtime target | LiteRT, GPU |

## det.tflite

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Model name | `yolo26n` |
| Original file name | `yolo26n_float16.tflite` |
| sha256 | `5950fac5e1a92adb17ad907b3925943c5c9dd29d59b0cbc1391efb4eb72740cf` |
| Upstream project | Ultralytics YOLO26 |
| Download source | ⚠️ **exact release URL TBD** |
| Model version / release tag | ⚠️ **TBD** |
| Code license | AGPL-3.0 (Ultralytics) |
| Weights license | AGPL-3.0 (as above) |
| Training dataset | COCO (80 classes) |
| Dataset license | Annotations are CC BY 4.0; images carry their own source terms. ⚠️ **Review before release** |
| Redistribution | Permitted, under AGPL-3.0 |
| Commercial use | Looser than sem (COCO has no non-commercial clause), but **still bound by the AGPL weights** |
| Export format | onnx2tf float16 export, NHWC |
| I/O | FLOAT32 `[1,640,640,3]` → `Identity` FLOAT32 `[1,84,8400]` (RAW_TRANSPOSED) |
| Runtime target | LiteRT, GPU |

## 🔴 The longest pole

**sem's Cityscapes non-commercial constraint is the hardest wall on this project's path to
commercialization, and no amount of repository splitting solves it** — it travels with the
**weights**, not the code license. Free distribution has a "non-commercial" argument; **selling
hardware is unambiguously commercial, and at that point sem must be replaced with a model trained on
commercially usable data.** This is unrelated to the A/B split — do not mistake "the core is Apache
now" for this problem being solved too.

## Required steps when changing a model

1. Run `py sailens/scripts/inspect_tflite.py <path>` and check it against the contract in
   [`models.md`](../sailens/docs/models.md).
2. **Verify class channel order semantics by hand.** Sailens Android's `SemanticModelPreflight`
   (sailens-guidance) checks that the output parses and that its class count matches the declared
   taxonomy — **it cannot check class order**. A wrong order does not error; it will quietly call
   a sidewalk a road, out loud, to someone who cannot see it. Test the argmax output on a known
   scene before discussing accuracy.
3. Update all ten fields in this document (including the sha256).
4. Build and launch this official distribution. It declares Guidance required, so a model whose output does not
   parse or whose class count is wrong stops at the fatal configuration screen before anyone can
   press start — that is the contract guard now. Sailens Android's own suite covers the check itself:
   `./gradlew :sailens:sailens-guidance:testDebugUnitTest` from this repository's root.
5. Re-check Sailens Android's performance red lines on a device (`sailens/docs/architecture.md`
   §12.3): `sem: postprocessBackend = "native_score"` and `outputReadTimeMs ≈ 0`;
   `det: postprocessBackend = "native_bbox_nms_float_handle"`.
   **Sailens Android has no weights and cannot verify these — this is the only place they can be
   checked.** §12.3 records which of them currently hold; a line already recorded as not holding
   there is a known pre-existing gap, not a regression from the new model.
